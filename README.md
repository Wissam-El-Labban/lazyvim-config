# lazyvim-config

preferred plugins and init lua file to get all plugins at once

credit for the plugins themselves goes to the authors:

copilot: https://github.com/github/copilot.vim
copilotchat: https://github.com/CopilotC-Nvim/CopilotChat.nvim
vscode color: https://github.com/Mofiqul/vscode.nvim

init lua file contents are what should be used if you want a colorscheme to persist (in our case its vscode).
